			<label style="font-size: 24px;color: brown"><b>BOWLING IN VILLAGE MARKET</b></label>
			<p>
				There’s a bowling ball, there’s the bowling lane, there are 10 bowling pins and there’s a screen to keep score. Each bowler has 10 rounds (frames) which contain two rolls each.
“In pin bowling, the goal is to knock over pins at the end of a lane, with two balls per frame allowed to knock down all pins. A strike is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked over on a second roll.” 
Scoring: They use the traditional scoring in the Village Market bowling system. “In general, one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. So if a player bowls over three pins with the first shot, then six with the second, the player would receive a total of nine points for that frame. If a player knocks down 9 pins with the first shot, but misses with the second, the player would also score nine. When a player fails to knock down all ten pins after their second ball it is known as an open frame. In the event that all ten pins are knocked over by a player in a single frame, bonuses are awarded.”

The word “boma” means “homestead”, and here you find replicates of traditional villages that provide interesting insight about each tribe’s societal structure, crafts, music, dancing and much more. The site was founded in 1971 by the Kenya Tourist Development Corporation to preserve the ancient traditions of the Kenyan people by building local and international awareness and advocacy. The bomas are built using the same techniques that are used by local tribes, so the experience is truly authentic, much as you would find in the remote communities of Kenya. The site is also home to an impressive auditorium, one of largest in Africa that seats 3,500 people to watch the internationally recognized Harambe dancers. Daily performances include a selection of more than 30 traditional dances of the different ethnic groups in Kenya, and one of the most impressive performances is the Samburu and Maasai warriors. Hosted events may also include music, theater, fashion show, poetry readings, sports, seminars and many other activities. Bomas of Kenya is located less than 7 miles (12 kilometers) from Nairobi’s city center and is very close to Nairobi National Park.
